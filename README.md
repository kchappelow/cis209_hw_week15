Problem: Polymorphism

Build a simple Java programming solution that meets the following criteria:

Create a superclass that defines a "Shape"

Create subclasses of "Shape" as "Rectangle", "Triangle" and "Circle." build into them the appropriate constructors and get and set methods.

The Rectangle will take a height and width.
The Triangle will take a base and height.
The Circle will take a radius.

Create a "calcArea" method in each of the subclasses that calculates the area appropriately.

Generate 10 random shapes of random (int) sizes and display the type of shape, their dimensions and their area.

Display the result to the user.

Task #1: Create a UML diagram for the superclass and subclasses.

Task #2: Write a test program that generates 10 random shapes of random (int) sizes and displays the type of shape,
their dimensions and their area and display the result to the user.

Task #3: Submit the superclass, subclasses, test program and UML diagram using git.
